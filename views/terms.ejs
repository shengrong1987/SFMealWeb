                We own and operate this website (SFMeal.com), the related mobile sites and mobile applications, and selected other domains (collectively, the "Sites"). These terms of use, as updated from time to time (the “Agreement”) constitute a contract between you and us and govern your use of the Sites at all times. What does that mean? It means that by accessing and/or using the Sites, you agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the Sites. As used in this Agreement, "SFMeal," "we," "us," and "our" shall mean [SFMeal.com, LLC] and its subsidiaries and affiliates. SFMeal provides an online technology platform and mobile application that connects hungry diners with local chefs (the "Platform"). Through the Platform, diners may order food cooked by our contracted chefs to be delivered to them in cities throughout the United States and other territories where SFMeal provides such services. SFMeal is not a restaurant or food preparation entity.
                The chefs available on our Sites operate independently and have entered into agreements with us to provide the food available to you on the Sites. SFMeal is not responsible for the chefs’ food preparation or safety and does not verify any chef’s compliance with applicable laws. In addition, SFMeal does not guarantee the quality of what the chefs sell, nor does it guarantee the services provided by the chef, including in those cases where the chef provides the delivery services. In addition, SFMeal does not independently verify representations made by chefs regarding their food, including without limitation any menu- or chef-level descriptors or disclosures.
                Some deliveries are provided by SFMeal’s network of independent delivery service providers (“DSPs”). SFMeal shall not be liable or responsible for any delivery services provided by DSPs or any errors or misrepresentations made by them.

                <br/><br/>
                You may only use the Sites to order if you are the authorized user of the method of payment used for payment and if you are able to form a binding contract with us. In addition, if you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Sites, and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement prior to your using the Sites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from using the Sites if you are under the age of 13. If you are using the Sites on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that organization.
                Use of the Sites to order requires that you register and/or create an account ("Account"). To register and create an Account, you may need to create a username and password and provide certain personal information. In consideration of the use of the Sites' services, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, or SFMeal has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, SFMeal has the right to block your current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you.
                You acknowledge that if SFMeal advances payment for certain of your orders placed via the Platform on your behalf, SFMeal shall separately send you invoices for payment of those advances. In the event that you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice (the “Payment Due Date”), you grant SFMeal the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law.
                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and password and for all activities or any other actions that occur under or are taken in connection with your password or Account. You agree to (a) immediately notify SFMeal of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. SFMeal will not be liable for any injury, loss or damage of any kind arising from or relating to your failure to comply with (a) and (b) or for any acts or omissions by you or someone else using your Account and/or password.

                User Content transmitted to certain parts of the Sites, including, without limitation, chef pages and certain Interactive Areas, may be posted in public areas on our Sites, including without limitation in a compilation format, and as such will be publicly visible and accessible. SFMeal and its officers, directors, employees, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, licensors, licensees, designees, business partners, contractors, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Released Parties") will not be responsible for, and you hereby expressly release the Released Parties from, any and all liability for the action of any and all third parties with respect to User Content.

We do our best to encourage civility and discourage disruptive communication on the Sites. We also discourage communications that incite others to violate our standards. We expect your cooperation in upholding our standards. You are responsible for all of your User Content. You agree not to provide any User Content that:
                is unlawful, harmful to adults or minors, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, offensive, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, and/or racially, ethnically and/or otherwise objectionable;

                is illegal and/or promotes illegal activity;
                contains unauthorized advertising and/or solicits users to a business other than those on the Sites; and/or
                is intended to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality or integrity of any computer software, hardware or Materials on the Sites or other websites.
                SFMeal may monitor any and all use of the Sites; however, we are under no obligation to do so. We may manage the Sites in a manner intended to protect our property and rights and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Sites. If any User Content or conduct on our Sites violates our standards, or any other terms and conditions of this Agreement; or interferes with other peoples' enjoyment of the Materials or our Sites; or that we believe is inappropriate; in our sole judgment, we reserve the right to change, delete or remove, in part or in full, any such User Content or Materials; and we further reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to any Interactive Areas or any Sites. SFMeal will cooperate with local, state and/or federal authorities to the extent required by applicable law in connection with User Content.
                V. Ratings and Reviews The Sites and other Interactive Areas may allow you to rate and post reviews of chefs and other businesses ("Ratings and Reviews"). Such Ratings and Reviews are considered User Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, your agreement regarding your use of Interactive Areas and the Sites' standards of conduct. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by SFMeal, and do not represent the views of SFMeal or of any affiliate or partner of SFMeal. SFMeal does not assume liability for Ratings and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities or losses resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We strive to maintain a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and other User Content. Therefore, all Ratings and Reviews must comply with the following criteria: (1) before posting a Rating or Review, you must have had first-hand experience with the chef; (2) you may not have a proprietary or other affiliation with either the chef or any of its competitors; (3) you may not draw any legal conclusions regarding the chefs' products, services or conduct; and (4) your review must otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement. Any Rating and/or Review that we determine, in our sole discretion, could diminish the integrity of the Ratings and Reviews, the Materials and/or the Sites may be removed or excluded by us without notice.

YOU AND SFMEAL AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THESE TERMS OF USE ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE.
                IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SITE OR DO NOT AGREE TO ANY PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SITE, EXCEPT AS MAY BE OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION.

                We own and operate this website (SFMeal.com), the related mobile sites and mobile applications, and selected other domains (collectively, the "Sites"). These terms of use, as updated from time to time (the “Agreement”) constitute a contract between you and us and govern your use of the Sites at all times. What does that mean? It means that by accessing and/or using the Sites, you agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the Sites. As used in this Agreement, "SFMeal," "we," "us," and "our" shall mean [SFMeal.com, LLC] and its subsidiaries and affiliates. SFMeal provides an online technology platform and mobile application that connects hungry diners with local chefs (the "Platform"). Through the Platform, diners may order food cooked by our contracted chefs to be delivered to them in cities throughout the United States and other territories where SFMeal provides such services. SFMeal is not a restaurant or food preparation entity.
                The chefs available on our Sites operate independently and have entered into agreements with us to provide the food available to you on the Sites. SFMeal is not responsible for the chefs’ food preparation or safety and does not verify any chef’s compliance with applicable laws. In addition, SFMeal does not guarantee the quality of what the chefs sell, nor does it guarantee the services provided by the chef, including in those cases where the chef provides the delivery services. In addition, SFMeal does not independently verify representations made by chefs regarding their food, including without limitation any menu- or chef-level descriptors or disclosures.
                Some deliveries are provided by SFMeal’s network of independent delivery service providers (“DSPs”). SFMeal shall not be liable or responsible for any delivery services provided by DSPs or any errors or misrepresentations made by them.

                <br/><br/>
                You may only use the Sites to order if you are the authorized user of the method of payment used for payment and if you are able to form a binding contract with us. In addition, if you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Sites, and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement prior to your using the Sites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are prohibited from using the Sites if you are under the age of 13. If you are using the Sites on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that organization.
                Use of the Sites to order requires that you register and/or create an account ("Account"). To register and create an Account, you may need to create a username and password and provide certain personal information. In consideration of the use of the Sites' services, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, or SFMeal has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, SFMeal has the right to block your current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you.
                You acknowledge that if SFMeal advances payment for certain of your orders placed via the Platform on your behalf, SFMeal shall separately send you invoices for payment of those advances. In the event that you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice (the “Payment Due Date”), you grant SFMeal the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law.
                You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and password and for all activities or any other actions that occur under or are taken in connection with your password or Account. You agree to (a) immediately notify SFMeal of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. SFMeal will not be liable for any injury, loss or damage of any kind arising from or relating to your failure to comply with (a) and (b) or for any acts or omissions by you or someone else using your Account and/or password.

                is illegal and/or promotes illegal activity;

We may manage the Sites in a manner intended to protect our property and rights and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Sites. If any User Content or conduct on our Sites violates our standards, or any other terms and conditions of this Agreement; or interferes with other peoples' enjoyment of the Materials or our Sites; or that we believe is inappropriate; in our sole judgment, we reserve the right to change, delete or remove, in part or in full, any such User Content or Materials; and we further reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to any Interactive Areas or any Sites.

                V. Ratings and Reviews The Sites and other Interactive Areas may allow you to rate and post reviews of chefs and other businesses ("Ratings and Reviews"). Such Ratings and Reviews are considered User Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, your agreement regarding your use of Interactive Areas and the Sites' standards of conduct. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by SFMeal, and do not represent the views of SFMeal or of any affiliate or partner of SFMeal. SFMeal does not assume liability for Ratings and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities or losses resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We strive to maintain a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and other User Content. Therefore, all Ratings and Reviews must comply with the following criteria: (1) before posting a Rating or Review, you must have had first-hand experience with the chef; (2) you may not have a proprietary or other affiliation with either the chef or any of its competitors; (3) you may not draw any legal conclusions regarding the chefs' products, services or conduct; and (4) your review must otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement. Any Rating and/or Review that we determine, in our sole discretion, could diminish the integrity of the Ratings and Reviews, the Materials and/or the Sites may be removed or excluded by us without notice.

Arbitration You agree that all claims, disputes or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement, or that in any way relate to your use of the Sites, the Materials and/or other content on the Sites, shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. You further acknowledge that any claim arising under this Agreement will be brought within one year of its accrual or it will be waived.
                II. Arbitration Rules The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowProperty?nodeId=/UCM/ADRSTAGE2021425& or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
                III. Arbitration Process A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased and a separate affidavit for waiver of fees for California residents only at https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTG_004304&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased .) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the county in which you reside and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
                IV. Arbitration Location and Procedure Unless you and SFMeal otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and SFMeal submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
                V. Arbitrator's Decision The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. SFMeal will not seek, and hereby waives all rights SFMeal may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if SFMeal prevails in arbitration.
                VI. Fees Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $25,000, SFMeal will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
                VII. Changes SFMeal reserves the right to change this "Dispute Resolution" section, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of such amendment. Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if SFMeal changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Sites after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may reject any such change by providing SFMeal written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: SFMeal, Attn: Dispute Resolutions, 221 Woodrow Street, Daly City, CA 94014, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and SFMeal in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement, as applicable).

Arbitration You agree that all claims, disputes or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement, or that in any way relate to your use of the Sites, the Materials and/or other content on the Sites, shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. Arbitration means that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the claim. Rights to prehearing exchange of information and appeals may also be limited in arbitration. You acknowledge and agree that you and SFMeal are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. You further acknowledge and agree that you waive your right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and SFMeal otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. You further acknowledge that any claim arising under this Agreement will be brought within one year of its accrual or it will be waived.

                Privacy Policy
                Last Updated: [ 10-23-2018 ]
                Welcome to SFmeal! Protecting your privacy is really important to us. Accordingly, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time that Information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll indicate when those changes will become effective. Finally, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.
                How We Collect and Use Information
                Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. We also use some of your PII to contact you, as described in our Terms of Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in the applicable communications. There are, however, some administrative communications that we have to send you from time to time, from which you cannot unsubscribe.
                Account Information. If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, and credit-card number or other billing information (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your date of birth, ZIP code, and other information that is not considered PII because it can’t be used by itself to identify you. We don’t receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts.
                Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies. Like many website and mobile-application operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.
                “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.
                “Web Beacons” (also known as clear gifs or) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on your hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).
                Information Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services, and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.
                Information Sent by Your Mobile Device. We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, such as a device identifier, user settings, and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.
                Location Information. In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or through GPS or sensor data from your device that provides information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers to locate your mobile device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you can disable that feature on your mobile device.
                How We Share Information with Third Parties
                We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:
                Information Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services, such as to deliver Meals you order. Such third-party service providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.
                Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes.
                Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from you, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
                Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
                Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request. We will share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.
                Security of Your Information
                We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we can’t guarantee the absolute security of any information.
                Identity theft and “phishing” are of great concern to us. Safeguarding your information to help protect you is a top priority for us. We won’t ever request any PII from you through unsolicited emails, text messages, or phone calls, so please don’t try to provide your PII to us except through our official Site and Apps.
                Links to Other Sites
                Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services, and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.
                Modifying Your Information
                You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by changing it in your Account profile. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at help@sfmeal.com with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.
                International Transfer
                Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it here.
                Our Policy Toward Children
                Our Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. Children under 13 are not permitted to use our Services, and if we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
